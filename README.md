# dressCode

A very "dumbed down" bit of code as an example of how input could be taken from an app on a mobile device and used to decide what products to show on the home page.  I didn't have a way to test the code, so it's possible there's an error here or there - this was mostly created to show my "style" as well as present an idea that came to mind.

Note to John- thanks for your time today, I appreciate the opportunity to work with you all.  Please feel free to get in contact if you have any further questions.
